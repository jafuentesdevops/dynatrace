üß† Full Description ‚Äì Enterprise Automated Monitoring System

This system is a fully modular, proactive monitoring and incident response automation platform built for high-demand enterprise environments. It combines real-time observability, intelligent alerting, and auto-remediation capabilities to reduce operational risk and mean time to recovery (MTTR).
üîß Core Components

    Monitoring Engine (EnterpriseMonitoringSystem)

        Executes scheduled system and API checks every 60 seconds (configurable).

        Evaluates thresholds, logs metrics, triggers alerts, and optionally runs automated remediation.

    Multi-Channel Alerting

        Sends alerts via SMTP email and webhooks (e.g., Slack).

        Supports multiple recipients and custom HTML messages.

        Webhook payloads include rich data for integration with incident platforms (e.g., ServiceNow, PagerDuty).

    Persistent Storage (SQLite)

        Logs:

            Historical metrics (CPU, RAM, disk, network).

            Incidents (with severity, message, timestamp, and resolution time).

        Enables full traceability and audit trails.

    Critical API Monitoring

        Tests availability and response times of key services (e-commerce API, DB status, payment gateways, CDN).

        Allows timeout customization and secure headers/token authentication.

    System Metrics Collection

        Captures:

            CPU usage (%)

            Memory and disk usage

            Load average, running processes, network connections

            Network traffic (MB sent/received)

‚ö†Ô∏è Alert Management

    Each metric has configurable warning and critical thresholds.

    Alerts are auto-resolved if values normalize.

    Automatic remediation supported per metric:

        restart_non_critical_services

        clear_cache

        clean_old_logs

        scale_instances

üö® Escalation and Security

    Alerts are escalated every 15 minutes if unresolved.

    Maximum of 3 automated attempts per incident (configurable).

    Token scopes follow least privilege principle.

    OAuth 2.0 supported for modern APIs.

üß™ Key Use Cases

    MTTR reduction via automated incident response

    SLA enforcement through API response monitoring

    Structured incident management with DB-backed event logs

    CI/CD integration using Quality Gates (SLO-based checks)

    Operational security by catching resource overloads, API failures, or silent degradations
